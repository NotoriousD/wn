          2.3.22. The affiliate shall not knowingly benefit from known or
          suspected traffic not generated using accepted Internet marketing
          practices whether or not it causes the Group harm. Should fraudulent,
          spam or unethical activity, knowingly or otherwise, arise from a
          person directed to a Group brand website via the affiliates link or
          other actions taken in furtherance of this Agreement, WinningPartner
          retains the right to withhold any Referral Fees to be paid to the
          affiliate at any time and the appropriate member of the Group may seek
          damages and indemnification, as appropriate. The Groups decision in
          this regard will be final. WinningPartner further reserves the right
          to retain all amounts otherwise due to the affiliate under this
          Agreement if it has reasonable cause to believe that such traffic has
          been caused with the affiliates knowledge. For Customers that are
          found to be engaging in or who have engaged in fraudulent activity or
          otherwise in breach of a Propertys terms and conditions with that
          Customer, WinningPartner reserves the right to deduct any Referral
          Fees earned by the affiliate from the activities of these Customers
          even where these Referral Fees had been previously paid to the
          affiliate. If the affiliate tag is not used in exactly the way it is
          given by the system, and altered in any way,WinningPartner reserves
          the right to deduct the Referral Fees earned by the affiliate from
          these altered tags, even if these Referral Fees had been previously
          paid out.

          3.1 Once you become an affiliate, you will have access to all
          marketing material containing a unique affiliate code. When your
          customer or contact links to or otherwise access a Property, the
          individual receives a cookie on his or computer or mobile device with
          your code. This code will generally stay on the individuals computer
          or mobile device for a period of 30 days unless removed. If your
          customer or contact leaves a Property site but returns while the
          cookie is active such individual will continue to be recognized as
          your potential Customer. If the individual registers with a"Group"
          Property during this time period, the individual's account will be
          tagged with your code.The Groupis not responsible for any problems or
          errors with the process of tagging an account with your code.

          unless you sent us notice of disagreement with the amount payable
          within twenty (20) days from the date payment is made. The failure to
          timely send such notice irrevocably waives your right to contest any
          fees due for the relevant time period and any prior time period.
